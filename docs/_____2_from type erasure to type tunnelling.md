# "type erasure" to "type tunneling"

As we recognized the subtile differnce between "tyoe erasure" and "type tunneling", std::any came tou our mind. As simple at it is, it is nevertheless the prototypical "type tunnel".
That is also all you can do with it. But with some love, that can be a lot.

To show you a litte example, lets immagine a simple "DB-System". An application can register factories for "types".
The Types are identified through a str::string. The factory gets a second string paramter, containig serialized date for that type.

https://github.com/andreaspfaffenbichler/virtual_void/blob/master/test/05_Sink_TypeErased_w_any_cast.cpp

An application can attach a "file" to that DB-System. That is a list of pairs of strings. first cantains the type and second the data of a serialized object.
When the Application queries the known objects of the file, the db calls for each pair the fitting factory and passes afterward the constructed object to the application.
In this first implementation, we will use std::any to hold the deserialized object.
To access the real object, we must use any cast, to test if we know the tunneled type, and if so we get the object for further processing.

Just for illustration purposes we take also a short look on an OO-Style implementation of this scenario.
https://github.com/andreaspfaffenbichler/virtual_void/blob/master/test/03_Sink_Inheritance_modern.cpp

If we compare the two distict strategies, we see, the have the downcast pattern in common. 
Form our type tunneling perspective, we can say the inherritance, the v-table and the "dynamic_cast" work together to form a "type tunnel".
If we look from the aspect of coupling, we see a difference. All the application classes are coupled to the IAny base. But after the "upcast" to "Data", the v-table run time dispatch decouples the types in the application layer-
````
void ReportSink(const DB::IAny* any) {
  if (auto data = dynamic_cast<const Data*>(any))
    std::cout << data->ToString() << std::endl;
}
````
With std::any have no dependency in the classes, but we have a strong coupling in the function "ReportSink" to all know types in the Application. With the OO is only a depenency to the highest abstraction level "Data".
This seams fine, because we look at only one sink for one query. Are thre many query sinks, and you want stay at this patter, one virtual function will not be enough and you will add virtual functions proprtional to the different sink you hav to serve with "Data". 

From this perspective, that that resembles the [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).
Visitor pattern is notorious for discomfort.
Interestingly, for the any case, there is a solution, that jummps in your eye:
Do the dispatch via typeid!

The first naiive aproach will look like this:
[test/05_Sink_TypeErased_w_any_dispach_simple.cpp](https://github.com/andreaspfaffenbichler/virtual_void/blob/master/test/05_Sink_TypeErased_w_any_dispach_simple.cpp)

From the standpoint of decoupling is this the best you can get. But this comes with a large runtime penalty...
Nevertheless, this aproach looks to appealing.
So will in the next step investigate, how big is the overhead we generate with map, function and any in comparison to plain v-tables.
For this we will use another example: An expression tree!
In OO-style ths goes like this:
https://github.com/andreaspfaffenbichler/virtual_void/blob/master/test/20_Tree_OO.cpp
We will use the expression tree to compute its value and to show a representation in forth and in lisp.
With a "catch" benchamrk we watch the runtime performance.

Now to the sample with our [naiive any dispatch] (https://github.com/andreaspfaffenbichler/virtual_void/blob/master/test/21_Tree_TE_dispatch_via_any.cpp)

On my laptop, i got this number with standard releas mode and MSVC 17

The value case shows the overhead cler. Not a surprise computers today are realy fast the in first rules of arithmetic, and the time neccessary to find the right function to call is a big part of the whole runtime.
As soon as there is a little relevant work todo in the found function, the time neccessary for dispatch is a smaller fraction. 
The overhead goes down from ~1.400% to ~30%.

30% overhead is still a lot, but worth a consideration, if it could help to escape visitor pattern hell or to get a hot header file out of the build time bottleneck.
We have not even tryed to speed up the things, so that's what we have to do next!
